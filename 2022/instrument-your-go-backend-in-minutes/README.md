# instrument-your-go-backend-in-minutes

This repo contains my presentation on Go backend instrumentation and the demo.

## Run demo

The easiest way to run the demo is to use the [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) tool. After installing it, spin up the k8s cluster and deploy all workloads using:
```bash
tilt up
```
